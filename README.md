BAN6420 Milestone Assignment 1: Policy Management System for an Insurance Company
An insurance company wants to create a policy management system to manage policyholders, products, and payments. The system should allow policy managers to perform various tasks, such as adding and suspending policyholders, registering new members, and managing policy products.

I have provided the following solutions:
# POLICYHOLDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This policyholder management script allows for the registratin, suspension, and reactivation policyholders based on whether or not they have been registered for any given product.

# PAYMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This payment management script allows for the processing of payments, reminders, and penalties for policyholders who have purchased insurance products. A 5% penalty charge applied against the policyholder on their unpaid balance for the insurance product.

# PRODUCT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This product management script allows for the creation, updating, and suspension of policy products.
Once a product's premium is updated, it immediately reflects the changes on the product used by the policyholder.
Once a product is suspended, it cannot be assigned to any policyholder.
